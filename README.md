 **Web Sockets in Golang:**
Web Sockets allow for full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. In Go, you can use packages like gorilla/websocket to handle Web Socket connections. This enables real-time communication between the server and clients, supporting bidirectional data flow.

**REST API in Golang:**
Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. In Golang, you can create RESTful APIs using the standard net/http package or frameworks like Gin or Echo. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.

**GraphQL in Golang:**
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. Golang has libraries like graphql-go/graphql or 99designs/gqlgen to build GraphQL APIs. It enables clients to request only the data they need, allowing more flexibility compared to REST APIs.

**gRPC in Golang:**
gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) framework. In Go, gRPC allows you to define services and message types using Protocol Buffers (protobuf). You can then generate client and server code to enable communication between them with strong typing and efficient serialization.
